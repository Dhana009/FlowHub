# FlowHub - API Testing & Automation Project
## 📋 Overview
FlowHub is a personal project built to strengthen understanding of API testing and automation using AI-assisted testing practices. It demonstrates end-to-end API design, implementation, and automated testing for multiple business workflows.
## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project was created to:
- Practice API contract design and implementation
- Explore **AI-assisted testing** to accelerate test development and improve coverage
- Validate API behavior, data integrity, and edge cases
- Understand real-world flow-based system testing
- Improve skills in Python, Pytest, REST API testing, and modern AI testing tools
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest
- **API Testing**: Requests library
- **API Validation**: JSON Schema Validation
- **AI-Assisted Testing**: Leveraged AI tools for test case generation and automation
## ✨ Key Features
- Multiple business flow endpoints with well-defined API contracts
- Request/response schema validation
- Automated API test cases using Pytest and Requests library
