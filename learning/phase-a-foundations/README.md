# Phase A: Foundations

**Status:** In Progress / Not Started

## Learning Objectives

Master foundational concepts before building:

1. **SDLC → STLC Flow**
   - How software development connects to testing lifecycle
   - Mapping to real projects

2. **System Flow Understanding**
   - UI → API → Backend → DB → API → UI
   - End-to-end request tracing

3. **Playwright Theory**
   - Contexts, pages, locators, auto-wait
   - Internal mechanics, not just definitions

4. **API Theory**
   - Routing, contracts, headers, methods, auth
   - Where each fits in the system flow

5. **Framework Reasoning**
   - Why POM, why utilities, why config layers
   - Design patterns for test automation

6. **Git/Version Control**
   - Branching, commits, PRs, merge conflicts
   - Best practices for test code

7. **Debugging Fundamentals**
   - Stack trace analysis
   - Test failure root cause identification
   - Basic logging strategies

8. **AI Prompting Fundamentals**
   - Recognizing hallucinations
   - Effective prompting for SDET tasks

## Phase Gate Criteria

To move to Phase B, you must demonstrate:
- ✅ Can explain SDLC → STLC flow and map to projects
- ✅ Understands system flow end-to-end
- ✅ Can explain Playwright core concepts (internals, not just definitions)
- ✅ Can explain API fundamentals (where each fits in flow)
- ✅ Understands framework reasoning
- ✅ Can use Git: branches, commits, basic merge conflicts
- ✅ Can debug: read stack traces, identify root cause
- ✅ Can explain AI prompting fundamentals and recognize hallucinations

## Learning Materials

- Notes and concepts will be added here as you progress
- Each concept must map to: resume → interviews → 3 core projects
