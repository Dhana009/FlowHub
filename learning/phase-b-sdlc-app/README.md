# Phase B: SDLC Simulator App (Project 1)

**Status:** Not Started (Requires Phase A completion)

## Project Overview

Build a minimal testable application that simulates SDLC processes. This app will later serve as the System Under Test (SUT) for automation in Phase C.

## Deliverables

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**
   - Generated with AI assistance
   - Clear requirements and scope

2. **Functional Specification**
   - Detailed feature specifications
   - User flows

3. **Architecture Design**
   - Frontend → API → Backend → DB
   - System flow documentation

4. **Working Application**
   - Minimal but functional
   - Testable UI and API endpoints

5. **Documentation**
   - Architecture explanation
   - Setup instructions
   - What needs to be tested

## Phase Gate Criteria

To move to Phase C, you must demonstrate:
- ✅ Minimal SDLC Simulator app exists and works
- ✅ Can explain app architecture: frontend → API → backend → DB
- ✅ Understands what needs to be tested: UI flows, API endpoints, data flow
- ✅ Can manually test the app and identify test scenarios
