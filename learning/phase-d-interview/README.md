# Phase D: Interview Preparation

**Status:** Not Started (Requires Phase C completion)

## Overview

Transform all learning into interview-ready narratives. Every concept must be explainable in interview context.

## Preparation Areas

### 1. Project Presentation Framework

Each of the 3 core projects must be presentable with:

- **Problem Statement:** What problem did it solve?
- **Architecture:** High-level system design (big-picture-first)
- **Technical Decisions:** Why this approach? Trade-offs?
- **Challenges Faced:** What went wrong? How did you debug?
- **Results:** What did you learn? How does it map to SDET role?

**Projects:**
1. SDLC Simulator App (Phase B)
2. MCP Hybrid Memory Agent (Project 2 - optional extension)
3. Classic Automation Framework (Phase C)

### 2. Common SDET Interview Questions

Mapped to your learning:

- **"Walk me through your test framework architecture."**
  → Maps to Project 3, Phase C learnings

- **"How do you handle flaky tests?"**
  → Maps to debugging skills, Phase A + Phase C

- **"Explain the system flow when a user clicks a button."**
  → Maps to Phase A system flow understanding

- **"How do you test APIs?"**
  → Maps to API theory + Project 3

- **"Tell me about a challenging bug you debugged."**
  → Maps to debugging fundamentals, real project experience

### 3. Behavioral Prep

- STAR method for project stories
- Connect every story to SDET skills: automation, debugging, system thinking
- Authenticity: only discuss what you can explain deeply

### 4. Technical Deep-Dives

- Playwright internals
- API testing strategies
- Framework design patterns
- Code review: reviewing test code and suggesting improvements
- System design: designing a test framework for a given system

## Deliverables

- Project narratives (30s, 3min, deep-dive versions)
- Resume updates with verified skills
- Mock interview practice sessions
- Common question answers mapped to your projects
