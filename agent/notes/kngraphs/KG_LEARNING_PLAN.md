# 📚 Learning Plan: Knowledge Graphs (20% Knowledge Set)

## Overview
This plan breaks down the 11 essential knowledge graph topics into a structured learning path with separate markdown files for each topic.

## Learning Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Topics 1-3)
**Goal:** Understand core concepts and when to use graphs
- **KG_01_Core_Graph_Concepts.md** - Nodes, relationships, properties, labels
- **KG_02_Entity_and_Mention_Concepts.md** - Entities vs mentions, deduplication
- **KG_03_Knowledge_Graph_vs_Other_Storages.md** - When to use graphs

**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Practice:** Draw a simple graph with nodes and relationships

---

### Phase 2: Design & Query (Topics 4-5)
**Goal:** Design schemas and write basic queries
- **KG_04_Graph_Schema_Design.md** - Node types, relationship types, properties
- **KG_05_Cypher_Essentials.md** - MERGE, MATCH, RETURN (only these!)

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Practice:** Design a schema for your project, write simple Cypher queries

---

### Phase 3: Ingestion & Integration (Topics 6-7)
**Goal:** Understand how data flows into graphs
- **KG_06_Ingestion_Pipeline_Concepts.md** - Structured vs unstructured ingestion
- **KG_07_Temporal_Relationships.md** - Time-aware memory concepts

**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Practice:** Design an ingestion pipeline for your use case

---

### Phase 4: Retrieval & System (Topics 8-10)
**Goal:** Query patterns and system integration
- **KG_08_Graph_Retrieval_Patterns.md** - Neighbors, paths, impact analysis
- **KG_09_Neo4j_as_the_Engine.md** - Neo4j basics
- **KG_10_Integration_and_Flow_with_LLM.md** - Complete architecture flow

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Practice:** Design retrieval patterns for your queries

---

### Phase 5: Production (Topic 11)
**Goal:** Real-world concerns
- **KG_11_Minimal_Production_Concerns.md** - Duplicates, logging, backup, performance

**Time:** 1 hour
**Practice:** Plan production setup for your system

---

## Total Learning Time
**Estimated:** 7-11 hours for complete mastery

## Learning Approach

### For Each Topic File:
1. **Read** the markdown file (10-15 minutes)
2. **Understand** the core concept
3. **Practice** with examples (if provided)
4. **Review** the "Why it matters" section
5. **Test** your understanding with the practice exercises

### Recommended Study Schedule:
- **Intensive:** 2-3 topics per day (1 week)
- **Moderate:** 1-2 topics per day (2 weeks)
- **Casual:** 1 topic per day (2 weeks)

## Success Criteria
After completing all 11 topics, you should be able to:
- ✅ Design a graph schema for your project
- ✅ Write basic Cypher queries (MERGE, MATCH, RETURN)
- ✅ Understand ingestion pipelines (structured and unstructured)
- ✅ Design retrieval patterns for common queries
- ✅ Explain when to use graphs vs other storage
- ✅ Integrate graphs with LLMs
- ✅ Handle basic production concerns

## Next Steps
1. Review this plan
2. Start with Phase 1 (Topics 1-3)
3. Complete each topic file in order
4. Practice with Neo4j
