# SDET Interview Focus Areas - Validated Research Summary

## Priority Areas (Validated by Perplexity + Gemini)

### Tier 1: Critical Focus (70% of preparation time)
1. **Framework Design** (95% of interviews)
   - Architecture decisions & trade-offs
   - Page Object Model (POM) depth
   - Scalability & maintainability
   - Test data management

2. **API Testing** (90% of interviews)
   - JWT authentication handling
   - Error scenarios & status codes
   - Real-world testing situations
   - Contract testing

3. **System Understanding** (80% of interviews)
   - UI → API → Backend → DB flow
   - Request tracing across layers
   - Microservices testing (senior roles)
   - Observability & debugging

### Tier 2: Important (20% of preparation time)
4. **SQL/Database Testing** (85% of interviews)
   - Data isolation strategies
   - Setup/teardown patterns
   - Data validation

5. **Programming/DSA** (75% of interviews)
   - OOP & design patterns (test context)
   - Practical coding (NOT LeetCode-style)
   - Basic DSA (collections, strings)

6. **Observability & Debugging** (70% of interviews)
   - Log analysis & correlation
   - Distributed tracing
   - CI/CD failure debugging

### Tier 3: Nice to Have (10% of preparation time)
7. **Cloud & Infrastructure** (65% - senior roles)
8. **Security Testing** (60%)

## 80/20 Breakdown (Critical 20% for 80% success)

1. Automation Skills (40% weight)
2. API Testing (25% weight)
3. Core Testing Skills (20% weight)
4. Tools & Process (15% weight)

## Theory vs Practice Balance

- **30% Theory** - Core concepts only
- **70% Practice** - Hands-on + real scenarios

## Minimum Viable Theory (Essential Only)

- STLC phases
- Test design techniques (BVA, EP, Decision Tables)
- Test types & levels
- Defect lifecycle

## Learning Sequence (8 Weeks)

- Week 1-2: Foundation (theory essentials)
- Week 3-4: Automation fundamentals
- Week 5-6: API testing + framework design
- Week 7-8: Interview preparation

## Success Formula

**Minimum Viable SDET = Core Theory + Automation Skills + API Testing + Real Project**
