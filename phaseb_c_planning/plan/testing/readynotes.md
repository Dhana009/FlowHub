Here’s the **cleanest, crispest, senior-level “Are you Ready?” checklist** —
no fluff, no stories, just **the exact 12 abilities** that prove you are *SDET-ready*.

If you can say “YES” to all 12 items,
you **can apply to SDET roles confidently**, anywhere.

This is the final readiness checklist.

---

# ⭐ **SDET Readiness Checklist (12/12 = READY)**

## ✅ **1. SDLC/STLC Mastery**

You can clearly explain:

* How SDLC works (end-to-end)
* How STLC works (end-to-end)
* How testers participate at each stage
  If asked suddenly, you can talk for 2–3 minutes without confusion.

---

## ✅ **2. System Flow Clarity**

You can explain the entire flow:
**UI → API → Backend → Database → Backend → API → UI**
…smoothly, like a story, without pausing.

---

## ✅ **3. Playwright Internal Concepts**

You can explain:

* Browser
* Context
* Page
* Locators
* Auto-waiting
* Assertions
* Why tests become flaky
  No code required — just pure conceptual clarity.

---

## ✅ **4. API Theory**

You can explain:

* API contract
* Headers
* Methods
* Status codes
* Request/Response cycle
* Routing
* Auth basics
  Like a backend engineer, not like a beginner tester.

---

## ✅ **5. Automation Framework Architecture**

You can confidently explain:

* folder structure
* POM
* config layer
* utilities
* test runner
* reporting
* logging
* environment handling
* API client
  If someone asks “Why did you design it this way?” — you have answers.

---

## ✅ **6. UI Automation (Playwright)**

You can:

* create a test
* debug a broken locator
* stabilize flaky tests
* understand selector strategies
* handle navigation + waits properly

---

## ✅ **7. API Automation**

You can:

* send requests
* validate responses
* handle tokens
* chain requests
* handle negative tests
* debug failed API calls

---

## ✅ **8. Debugging Skills**

You are comfortable with:

* reading errors
* reading logs
* checking network tab
* analyzing stack traces
* identifying root cause
* isolating flaky tests

Most juniors fail here — if you pass this, you’re SDET level.

---

## ✅ **9. Git + CI/CD Basics**

You can:

* commit, push, branch
* raise a PR
* fix merge conflicts (basic)
* run CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)
* read CI logs

These are minimum industry expectations.

---

## ✅ **10. Testing Techniques**

You can explain:

* equivalence partitioning
* boundary value analysis
* decision tables
* state transition
* risk-based testing
* traceability

This separates seniors from beginners in interviews.

---

## ✅ **11. Three Projects Are Real and Explainable**

You can explain:

### Project 1 → SDLC App

### Project 3 → Automation Framework

### Project 2 → MCP Hybrid Agent (optional premium)

You can explain:

* the architecture
* challenges
* your decisions
* your testing strategy

This is what impresses interviewers most.

---

## ✅ **12. Interview Communication**

You can answer:

* “Explain your framework.”
* “Explain Playwright architecture.”
* “Explain an API contract.”
* “Tell me a challenge you solved.”
* “Explain your project architecture.”
  …clearly and confidently.

If you can do this, you are **100% ready.**

---

# ⭐ **Summary (If you want the simplest version)**

You are SDET-ready when you can:

### **understand → build → automate → debug → explain**

If all 12 boxes are checked,
you’re not “getting ready” anymore —
you’re already **a full SDET**.

---

If you want, I can convert this into:

* a **Google Sheets checklist**
* a **progress tracker**
* a **weekly plan**
* or a **self-scoring sheet (1–5)**

Just tell me.
