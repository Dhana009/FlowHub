SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------
SDET with 2.5+ years of experience in software testing, UI/API 
validation, and automation engineering. Strong understanding of 
SDLC, STLC, test design principles, and full system flows across 
UI → API → backend → database. Designed and built a Playwright-based 
automation framework and a small full-stack web application used as 
the System Under Test (SUT). Experienced with AI-assisted 
documentation and modern tooling.
