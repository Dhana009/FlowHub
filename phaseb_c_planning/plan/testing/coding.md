# **PHASE E.2 — CODING ROUND MASTERY (MASTER DOCUMENT v1.0)**

**Purpose:** Master SDET coding rounds by solving practical problem-solving, automation-oriented logic, API/data manipulation, and framework-thinking problems. This ensures you can think clearly under pressure, explain reasoning like an SDET, and write clean, modular, testable code.

---

## **1. What Phase E.2 Is**

Phase E.2 is:

> **"Coding Round Mastery + Problem-Solving Skills + Automation-Oriented Logic + Framework Thinking + Real Interview Coding Practice."**

It transforms your coding ability from:
* Basic Python knowledge →
* SDET-level coding proficiency

This phase ensures you:
* Solve real coding round problems confidently
* Think clearly under pressure
* Explain your reasoning like an SDET
* Write clean, modular, testable code
* Connect logic to automation roles

---

## **2. Why Phase E.2 Exists**

Phase E.2 solves the critical gap:

> **SDET interviews ALWAYS have a coding round**, but most QA engineers prepare LeetCode-style problems instead of **SDET-style coding**.

**Why it was postponed initially:**
* You were still building foundational mental models
* You didn't yet understand automation flow, framework design, or API fundamentals
* Without strong fundamentals, you would struggle with SDET-style coding problems
* You were still shaping your overall SDET profile

**Why it's needed now:**
* Your foundation is strong (Phases A–C complete)
* You understand automation flow and framework design
* You're ready for interview preparation (Phase E)
* Coding rounds are a core part of SDET interviews

**Industry Reality:**
* Many QA engineers fail because they prepare LeetCode but not **SDET-style coding**
* Interviewers test: logical thinking, data manipulation, clean code principles, testability, communication
* SDET coding rounds focus on: arrays/strings, JSON manipulation, automation utilities, framework design, scenario-based problems

Phase E.2 ensures you're prepared for **real SDET coding expectations**, not generic software engineer problems.

## **4. How Phase E.2 Fits in the A → B → C → D → E → E.2 Flow**

Phase E.2 sits here:

**Phase A → Phase B → Phase C → Phase D → Phase E → Phase E.2**

Why?

Because **you cannot** master interviews (Phase E) without:
* Coding round preparation (Phase E.2)
* Problem-solving skills (Phase E.2)
* Framework-thinking in code (Phase E.2)
* Real interview coding practice (Phase E.2)

Phase E.2 **enhances** Phase E by providing:
* SDET-specific coding problems (not generic LeetCode)
* Automation-oriented logic (not general algorithms)
* Framework design in code (not just theory)
* Real interview simulation (not just practice)

---

## **5. The Persona Used for Phase E.2**

When executing Phase E.2, the AI model must take the role of:

> **"Senior SDET Interviewer + Coding Coach + Problem Setter"**

Responsibilities:
* Present SDET-specific coding problems
* Evaluate logical thinking and code quality
* Provide feedback on approach and implementation
* Simulate real interview coding rounds
* Guide through problem-solving process
* Ensure code is clean, modular, and testable

This persona complements Phase E's "Senior SDET Interviewer + Industry Research Analyst + Question Bank Curator."
