# Phase Navigation Commands

Commands to navigate between learning phases and check readiness.

## Start Phases
- `@start-phase-a` - Begin Phase A: Foundations (SDLC, STLC, system flows, Playwright theory, API theory, Git, debugging)
- `@start-phase-b` - Begin Phase B: Build SDLC Simulator App (Project 1)
- `@start-phase-c` - Begin Phase C: Build Automation Framework (Project 3)
- `@start-phase-d` - Begin Phase D: Interview Mastery (resume, narratives, mock interviews)

## Phase Readiness Checks
- `@check-phase-a` - Validate Phase A → B gate criteria (can explain SDLC/STLC, system flows, Playwright concepts, API theory, framework reasoning, Git, debugging)
- `@check-phase-b` - Validate Phase B → C gate criteria (app complete, documented, architecture understood)
- `@check-phase-c` - Validate Phase C → D gate criteria (framework works, CI/CD green, can explain architecture)

## Phase Status
- `@current-phase` - Show current phase and what's next
- `@phase-progress` - Display progress within current phase
- `@show-all-phases` - Display overview of all 4 phases
