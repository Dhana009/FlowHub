# Topic 2: API Testing - Focus Areas

## Where to Focus (Priority-Based)

### CRITICAL Priority (Spend Most Time Here)

1. **JWT Token Validation & Signature Verification**
   - Asked in real interviews
   - Shows security understanding
   - Token structure knowledge
   - Signature verification process

2. **Status Code Verification**
   - Fundamental knowledge
   - Always asked
   - 2xx, 4xx, 5xx understanding
   - Appropriate status codes per HTTP method

3. **Response Schema Validation**
   - Ensures data integrity
   - Frequently tested
   - JSON schema validation
   - Data type checking

4. **API Test Design Principles**
   - Setup → Execution → Verification → Reporting → Cleanup
   - Shows structured thinking
   - Complete testing lifecycle

### HIGH Priority (Important but Secondary)

5. **Authentication Methods**
   - API keys
   - OAuth tokens
   - JWT handling
   - Security-focused interviews emphasize this

6. **Error Handling & Timeout Implementation**
   - Real-world scenario testing
   - 4xx vs 5xx error handling
   - Timeout strategies
   - Rate limit handling

7. **Data-Driven Testing Approaches**
   - Scalability demonstration
   - Multiple data sources
   - Parameterization
   - Test data management

### MEDIUM Priority (Good to Know)

8. **API Documentation Testing**
   - Less frequently asked
   - Shows completeness
   - OpenAPI/Swagger testing
   - Contract testing

9. **Load Testing & Performance Validation**
   - For senior SDET roles
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Scalability testing

### LOW Priority (Nice to Have)

10. **Blockchain/IoT/PWA Testing**
    - Emerging but rarely asked
    - Unless role-specific
    - Can mention but not critical

## What Matters Most

1. **JWT Token Validation** - Security understanding, frequently asked
2. **Status Code Verification** - Fundamental, always asked
3. **Response Schema Validation** - Data integrity, frequently tested
4. **API Test Design Principles** - Structured approach, complete lifecycle
5. **Authentication & Authorization** - Security focus, critical for interviews
6. **Error Handling** - Real-world scenarios, edge cases
