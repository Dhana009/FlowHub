# Topic 2: API Testing - Success Criteria

## If You Can Do These, You're Interview-Ready

### Fundamental Level

- ✅ Explain the complete API testing procedure with all 5 phases (Setup, Execution, Verification, Reporting, Cleanup)
- ✅ List what must be checked in API testing: accuracy, schema, status codes, data types, authorization, timeouts, error codes
- ✅ Explain HTTP methods and communication protocols
- ✅ Distinguish between API testing and UI testing; explain integration approach

### Authentication & Security

- ✅ Validate JWT tokens by verifying signatures using public keys and algorithm validation
- ✅ Handle authentication in test frameworks (API keys, OAuth tokens)
- ✅ Explain token expiration handling in tests
- ✅ Manage API keys securely in test framework

### Test Design & Validation

- ✅ Design API test cases using boundary value and equivalence class techniques
- ✅ Verify API responses against expected results
- ✅ Validate response schemas and data types
- ✅ Handle status codes appropriately (2xx, 4xx, 5xx)

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

- ✅ Handle timeouts and rate limits appropriately
- ✅ Test error codes (4xx client errors, 5xx server errors)
- ✅ Handle unexpected status codes
- ✅ Explain difference between 4xx and 5xx errors

### Integration & Framework

- ✅ Integrate API tests with UI automation for end-to-end testing
- ✅ Implement data-driven testing in API frameworks
- ✅ Structure maintainable, scalable API test frameworks
- ✅ Handle test data cleanup after execution

### Advanced (Senior SDET Roles)

- ✅ Implement distributed testing across multiple environments
- ✅ Handle microservices API testing
- ✅ Implement continuous testing with CI/CD integration
- ✅ Handle real-time applications testing
