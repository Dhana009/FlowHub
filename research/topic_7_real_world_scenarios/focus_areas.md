# Topic 7: Real-World Scenario-Based Questions - Focus Areas

## Where to Focus (Priority-Based)

### CRITICAL Priority (Spend Most Time Here)

1. **API Response Validation Beyond Status Codes**
   - 80% of SDET work involves API testing
   - Validating response body, not just status codes
   - Schema validation
   - Data consistency checks
   - Most frequently tested

2. **Async Operation Handling & Synchronization**
   - Most common source of flaky tests
   - Timeout strategies
   - Polling vs event-driven
   - Failure handling
   - Critical for test reliability

3. **Test Data Design & Isolation**
   - Determines test reliability and maintainability
   - Data isolation strategies
   - Cleanup approaches
   - PII handling
   - Essential for parallel execution

### HIGH Priority (Important but Secondary)

4. **Root Cause Analysis Methodology**
   - Shows debugging maturity
   - Systematic approach
   - Failure point identification
   - Data consistency validation

5. **Framework Design Patterns**
   - Demonstrates architecture thinking
   - Page Object Model
   - Builder patterns
   - Factory patterns

6. **Error Handling & Retry Strategies**
   - Production-like scenarios
   - Idempotency handling
   - Retry logic
   - Failure recovery

### MEDIUM Priority (Good to Know)

7. **Performance Testing Basics**
   - Secondary but increasingly asked
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Scalability considerations

8. **CI/CD Integration & Test Reporting**
   - DevOps alignment
   - Pipeline integration
   - Reporting strategies

## What Matters Most

1. **API Response Validation** - 80% of SDET work (CRITICAL)
2. **Async Operation Handling** - Most common flakiness source (CRITICAL)
3. **Test Data Design** - Foundation of reliable tests (CRITICAL)
4. **Root Cause Analysis** - Debugging maturity (HIGH)
5. **Framework Design** - Architecture thinking (HIGH)
6. **Error Handling** - Production scenarios (HIGH)
