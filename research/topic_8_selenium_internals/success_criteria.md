# Topic 8: Selenium Internals & Advanced Concepts - Success Criteria

## If You Can Do These, You're Interview-Ready

### Stale Element Mastery

- ✅ Explain SEE root cause in a React/Angular app without prompting
- ✅ Design a retry mechanism that handles SEE gracefully
- ✅ Identify SEE vs. other element-not-found errors in logs
- ✅ Handle SEE in a table where rows are dynamically added
- ✅ Explain difference between SEE in static page vs. SPA
- ✅ Explain if you can prevent SEE entirely or only handle it
- ✅ Explain how implicit wait affects SEE occurrence

### Locator Resilience

- ✅ Write XPath using axes for complex nested structures
- ✅ Explain why your locators won't break with UI changes
- ✅ Use relative locators for elements without stable IDs
- ✅ Write XPath to find button inside modal that appears after clicking
- ✅ Locate element when its ID changes on every page load
- ✅ Use XPath axes to make locators more maintainable
- ✅ Locate element inside shadow DOM

### Synchronization Expertise

- ✅ Distinguish between implicit, explicit, and fluent waits
- ✅ Explain when each wait type is appropriate
- ✅ Handle race conditions in AJAX-heavy applications
- ✅ Explain performance implications of different wait strategies
- ✅ Handle elements that require focus before interaction

### Advanced Selenium 4 Features

- ✅ Use relative locators confidently
- ✅ Navigate shadow DOM in your tests
- ✅ Explain BiDi (Bidirectional) protocol benefits
- ✅ Use Selenium 4 features for modern web apps

### Judgment & Trade-offs

- ✅ Know when JavaScript executor is appropriate vs. overused
- ✅ Explain when to use JS executor instead of Selenium's native methods
- ✅ Explain difference between `execute_script()` and `execute_async_script()`
- ✅ Handle JavaScript errors during execution
- ✅ Access browser console logs from tests
- ✅ Discuss maintainability vs. robustness trade-offs

### Browser Configuration

- ✅ Handle self-signed certificates in staging environment
- ✅ Explain difference between `acceptInsecureCerts` and `acceptSslCerts`
- ✅ Ensure tests work across environments with different certificate configurations
- ✅ Pre-configure browser permissions in test setup
- ✅ Handle geolocation prompts in automation
