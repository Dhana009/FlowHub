# Topic 1: Framework Design - Focus Areas

## Where to Focus (Priority-Based)

### CRITICAL Priority (Spend Most Time Here)

1. **Page Object Model (POM) Design**
   - Asked in 90%+ of interviews
   - Demonstrates scalability thinking
   - Core design pattern knowledge

2. **Wait Strategies**
   - Implicit vs explicit waits
   - Fluent waits
   - Custom wait conditions
   - Directly impacts test reliability
   - Shows synchronization expertise

3. **Test Framework Integration**
   - TestNG/JUnit setup
   - Foundation for parallel execution
   - Reporting integration

### HIGH Priority (Important but Secondary)

4. **Parallel Execution with Selenium Grid**
   - Optimization mindset
   - Crucial for large-scale automation
   - Thread management
   - Test isolation

5. **Data-Driven Testing Implementation**
   - Framework flexibility
   - Reusability demonstration
   - External data sources
   - Parameterization

6. **Shadow DOM and Modern Web Components**
   - Current industry need
   - Differentiates candidates
   - JavaScriptExecutor usage
   - Modern web application handling

### MEDIUM Priority (Good to Know)

7. **Docker/Containerization Integration**
   - DevOps awareness
   - Increasingly expected in 2024-2025
   - Consistent environments
   - Scalable infrastructure

8. **BDD Framework Integration (Cucumber/Gherkin)**
   - Bridges technical-business gap
   - Shows communication skills
   - Feature files
   - Step definitions

9. **Cloud Testing Platform Integration**
   - Scalability demonstration
   - Resource optimization
   - RemoteWebDriver usage

### LOW Priority (Nice to Have)

10. **Custom Reporting Mechanisms**
    - Nice-to-have
    - Rarely deep-dived in interviews
    - Can mention but not critical

## What Matters Most

1. **POM Architecture** - Most frequently asked
2. **Wait Strategies** - Critical for test reliability
3. **Framework Scalability** - How it handles growth
4. **Modern Web Testing** - Shadow DOM, containers
5. **Integration Capabilities** - TestNG, parallel execution
