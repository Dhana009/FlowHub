# Topic 1: Framework Design - Success Criteria

## If You Can Do These, You're Interview-Ready

### Architectural Level

- ✅ Design a framework from scratch explaining each layer's responsibility
- ✅ Justify why you chose POM over keyword-driven or hybrid approaches
- ✅ Explain how your framework handles 100+ tests without maintenance overhead
- ✅ Describe how your framework scales from 10 to 1000 tests

### Technical Implementation

- ✅ Implement custom wait conditions for application-specific behaviors
- ✅ Design a data-driven testing approach with external data sources
- ✅ Explain parallel execution strategy and thread safety considerations
- ✅ Handle shadow DOM elements using JavaScriptExecutor

### Real-World Problem Solving

- ✅ Describe how you'd handle browser crashes during test execution
- ✅ Explain your strategy for cross-browser testing across 5+ browsers
- ✅ Design a framework that works with both Selenium and modern tools (Playwright)
- ✅ Handle SSL certificate warnings without hardcoding workarounds

### Code Quality & Maintainability

- ✅ Write locators that survive UI changes (relative positioning, multiple attributes)
- ✅ Implement fluent waits with customized polling intervals for dynamic elements
- ✅ Design base classes that reduce code duplication across 200+ test cases
- ✅ Explain how you'd refactor a monolithic test class into maintainable modules

## Readiness Indicators

**You're ready if you can:**
1. Explain framework architecture from scratch
2. Justify design pattern choices (POM vs others)
3. Handle scalability challenges (10 to 1000 tests)
4. Implement advanced wait strategies
5. Design data-driven testing approach
6. Explain parallel execution with thread safety
7. Handle modern web components (Shadow DOM)
8. Solve real-world problems (browser crashes, cross-browser)
9. Demonstrate maintainability thinking (refactoring, code organization)
10. Show framework-agnostic design capability
