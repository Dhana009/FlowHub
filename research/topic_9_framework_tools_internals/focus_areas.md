# Topic 9: Framework Tools Internals - Focus Areas

## Where to Focus (Priority-Based)

### CRITICAL Priority (Spend Most Time Here)

1. **TestNG @DataProvider + @Factory**
   - 80% of parameterized test questions
   - 40% of prep time
   - Most critical topic
   - Performance with large datasets
   - When to use each

2. **Maven Profiles + Dependency Resolution**
   - Build pipeline configuration in every SDET role
   - 30% of prep time
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Version conflict resolution
   - Critical for CI/CD

3. **Git Merge Conflicts + Branching Strategies**
   - Daily workflow; shows maturity
   - 20% of prep time
   - Most common Git question
   - Team collaboration scenarios
   - Essential for SDET role

### HIGH Priority (Important but Secondary)

4. **Postman Collections + Environments**
   - API testing is core SDET skill
   - 25% of prep time
   - Variable management
   - Environment-specific configs
   - Important for API testing

5. **TestNG Parallel Execution + Thread Safety**
   - Performance testing scenarios
   - 20% of prep time
   - Resource contention
   - Database-dependent tests
   - Thread safety implications

6. **Maven Lifecycle + Plugin Binding**
   - CI/CD integration questions
   - 15% of prep time
   - Build phases
   - Plugin configuration
   - Important for automation

### MEDIUM Priority (Good to Know)

7. **Postman Pre-request/Test Scripts**
   - Advanced API testing
   - 15% of prep time
   - Token refresh logic
   - Request chaining
   - Less frequent but valuable

8. **Git Stash + Rebase**
   - Less common but shows expertise
   - 10% of prep time
   - Work-in-progress handling
   - History management
   - Advanced Git knowledge

### LOW Priority (Specific Use Cases)

9. **Postman OAuth/Certificate Auth**
   - Specific to certain companies
   - 5% of prep time
   - OAuth 2.0 flows
   - SSL certificate handling
   - Less frequently asked

## What Matters Most

1. **TestNG @DataProvider + @Factory** - Most critical (80% of questions)
2. **Maven Profiles + Dependency Resolution** - Build pipeline (30% of prep time)
3. **Git Merge Conflicts + Branching** - Daily workflow (20% of prep time)
4. **Postman Collections + Environments** - API testing (25% of prep time)
5. **TestNG Parallel Execution** - Performance scenarios (20% of prep time)
6. **Maven Lifecycle** - CI/CD integration (15% of prep time)

## Time Investment Summary

- **CRITICAL**: 90% of prep time (TestNG, Maven, Git core)
- **HIGH**: 60% of prep time (Postman, TestNG advanced, Maven advanced)
- **MEDIUM**: 25% of prep time (Postman scripts, Git advanced)
- **LOW**: 5% of prep time (Postman OAuth/certificate)
