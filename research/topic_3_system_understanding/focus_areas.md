# Topic 3: System Understanding - Focus Areas

## Where to Focus (Priority-Based)

### Priority 1 (60% Study Time - Spend Most Time Here)

1. **Request Flow Tracing Through Microservices**
   - UI → Load Balancer → API Gateway → Service → Database
   - How to trace requests across services
   - Testing points at each layer
   - Most frequently asked

2. **API Testing Strategies and Challenges**
   - Contract testing approaches
   - Integration testing patterns
   - API versioning impact
   - Frequently tested

3. **Database Interaction Patterns and Testing**
   - Data setup/teardown strategies
   - Test data isolation
   - Database testing in microservices
   - Critical for interviews

4. **Service Communication Patterns**
   - Sync vs Async communication
   - When to use each
   - Testing implications
   - Core knowledge

### Priority 2 (25% Study Time - Important but Secondary)

5. **Event-Driven Architecture and Testing Implications**
   - Message queue patterns
   - Event sourcing testing
   - Async testing challenges
   - Growing importance

6. **Circuit Breaker Patterns and Failure Handling**
   - Resilience patterns
   - Failure scenario testing
   - Circuit breaker behavior testing
   - Advanced topic

7. **Load Balancing and Routing Logic**
   - How load balancing works
   - Testing routing scenarios
   - Distribution testing
   - Infrastructure knowledge

8. **Caching Strategies and Cache Invalidation**
   - Cache testing approaches
   - Cache invalidation scenarios
   - Cache consistency testing
   - Performance consideration

### Priority 3 (15% Study Time - Good to Know)

9. **Message Queue Patterns and Testing**
   - Queue testing strategies
   - Message ordering
   - Dead letter queue testing
   - Advanced topic

10. **Monitoring and Observability**
    - Using traces/metrics for testing
    - Observability-driven testing
    - Debugging with observability
    - Modern approach

11. **Security Testing in Distributed Systems**
    - Security across services
    - Token validation
    - Security headers testing
    - Important but less frequent

12. **Performance Testing Considerations**
    - Performance in distributed systems
    - Bottleneck identification
    - Scalability testing
    - Senior-level topic

## What Matters Most

1. **Request Flow Tracing** - Most frequently asked (90% of interviews)
2. **API Testing Strategy** - Critical for SDET role
3. **Database Testing** - Essential for integration testing
4. **Service Communication** - Core distributed systems knowledge
5. **Failure Scenarios** - Real-world problem solving
