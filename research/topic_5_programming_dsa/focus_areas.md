# Topic 5: Programming/DSA - Focus Areas

## Where to Focus (Priority-Based)

### CRITICAL Priority (35-40% Interview Weight - Spend Most Time Here)

1. **OOP Principles Applied to Test Frameworks**
   - Foundation of maintainable automation
   - Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction
   - Most frequently tested
   - Core programming knowledge

2. **Page Object Model Design & Implementation**
   - Most common SDET coding question
   - POM variations and patterns
   - Design decisions
   - Critical for interviews

### HIGH Priority (15-20% Interview Weight - Important)

3. **Collections & Data Structure Selection**
   - Test data management efficiency
   - When to use List vs Set vs Dictionary
   - Performance implications
   - Practical application

4. **API Response Parsing (JSON/XML)**
   - Modern test automation reality
   - JSON parsing and validation
   - XML handling
   - Nested data extraction

### MEDIUM Priority (5-15% Interview Weight - Good to Know)

5. **String Operations & Regex**
   - Validation and assertion logic
   - Pattern matching
   - Text extraction
   - Case-insensitive comparisons

6. **Basic Sorting/Filtering Algorithms**
   - Test data preparation
   - Result sorting
   - Data filtering
   - Practical algorithms

### LOW Priority (<5% Interview Weight - Rarely Asked)

7. **Complex Algorithmic Problems**
   - Rarely asked in SDET interviews
   - Not LeetCode-style problems
   - Can mention but not critical
   - Focus on practical application

## What Matters Most

1. **OOP Principles** - Foundation of test frameworks (35-40%)
2. **Page Object Model** - Most common coding question (25-30%)
3. **Collections & Data Structures** - Test data management (15-20%)
4. **API Response Parsing** - Modern automation reality (15-20%)
5. **String Operations** - Validation logic (10-15%)
