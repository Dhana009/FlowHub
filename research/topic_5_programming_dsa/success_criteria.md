# Topic 5: Programming/DSA - Success Criteria

## If You Can Do These, You're Interview-Ready

### Design & Implementation

- ✅ Create a multi-layer test framework from scratch (Page Objects → Test Cases → Utilities)
- ✅ Implement inheritance hierarchies for test base classes
- ✅ Design factory patterns for test data generation
- ✅ Explain trade-offs between different design approaches

### Write Production-Quality Code

- ✅ Write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) test code with reusable components
- ✅ Implement proper error handling and logging in test utilities
- ✅ Use appropriate collections for different test scenarios
- ✅ Write assertions that are clear and maintainable

### Handle Real-World Scenarios

- ✅ Parse and validate API responses (JSON/XML)
- ✅ Extract dynamic data from UI/API for subsequent test steps
- ✅ Manage test data with collections efficiently
- ✅ Handle string operations for validation logic

### Optimize & Troubleshoot

- ✅ Identify performance bottlenecks in test code
- ✅ Refactor duplicated test logic into reusable utilities
- ✅ Explain why certain design patterns improve test maintainability
- ✅ Debug test failures by analyzing code flow
